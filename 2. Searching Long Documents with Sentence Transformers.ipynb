    "- On your search for an optimal document retrieval method in the CDC’s huge knowledge base you decide to implement a semantic search engine to overcome known limitations of statistical (TfIdf) full-text search. Its weaknesses stem from the fact that it relies on counting and matching words in a search query with documents in the database in the document. Even though modern full-text search engines do include, synonyms, for example, still there are many ways to express the same idea. You know that Transformers models excel at contextual learning, so you decide to apply transfer learning with pre-trained BERT models to see if you can make your search engine smarter."
